#OpenTrack#

A simple script to help you track who opens your emails.

Designed to be used with messages sent via custom auto-mailing scripts.

##Versions##

This is the unstable development version. It is not recommended to use this version for anything other than your own development/proof-of-concepts. If you want to use this script, please look at either the [Master](https://github.com/Ultrabenosaurus/OpenTrack/) or [V1.4](https://github.com/Ultrabenosaurus/OpenTrack/tree/V1.4) branches.

A barebones, stable non-class-based version is also available in the [V1.0 branch](https://github.com/Ultrabenosaurus/OpenTrack/tree/V1.0) if you only need minimal tracking abilities.

##Working On##

##To Do##
